              OpenAS2 Server
              Version 2.1.1
              RELEASE NOTES

The OpenAS2 project is pleased to announce the release of OpenAS2 2.1.1

The release download file is: OpenAS2Server-2.1.1.zip
The zip file contains a PDF document providing information on installing and using the application.

This release is a bugfix release:
  1. Fix sending HTTP headers in a synchronous MDN that are copied from the inbound message causing some AS2 implementations to fail

Upgrade Notes (if upgrading from versions older than 2.1.0):
  1. Add the new module to your existing config.xml (see classname="org.openas2.processor.msgtracking.DbTrackingModule" in release config.xml)
  2. If using a custom startup script, re-integrate your customisations into the new script
  
Java 1.5 or later is required.

NOTE FOR JAVA 1.5: 
	Prior to java 1.6, the Javabeans Activation Framework is NOT included in the standard Java install. Download the 1.1.1 version and extract from the zip file from this web page:
	   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-java-plat-419418.html#jaf-1.1.1-fcs-oth-JPR
	The activation.jar must be placed into the “lib” folder of the OpenAS2 server install and added to the class path in the shell or batch file as appropriate.
	You will not be able to use the H2 databse tracking module with Java 1.5 and the module will have to be disabled in the config.xml file

NOTE FOR JAVA 1.6: 
	The version of H2 database included in this release used for storing tracking messages will only support Java 1.7.
	If you do not need the DB tracking feature then simply remove it from the config.xml file.
	Otherwise:
		- download the older version of H2 that was compiled with support for Java 1.6 from this site:
			https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/h2database/h2-2014-01-18.zip
		- Extract the file named h2-1.3.175.jar from the zip and replace the h2-1.4.192.jar in the "lib" folder with this one.
		- Change the startup script to include the replaced version of H2 jar in the classpath
		- Import the DDL (located in the config folder as db_ddl.sql) into the DB created by the older version like this:
			java -cp [path to OpenAS2 install]/lib/h2-1.3.175.jar org.h2.tools.RunScript -user sa -password OpenAS2 -url jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/openas2 -script [path to OpenAS2 install]/config/db_ddl.sql
